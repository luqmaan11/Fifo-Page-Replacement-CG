# Fifo-Page-Replacement-CG

Fifo Page Replacement Algorithm is a computer graphics project developed using the latest OpenGL libraries. OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.
We use polygon fill with different colors to differentiate between the stack elements and the page elements. And to represent the reference string and the page elements we use OpenGL primitives such as GL_POLYGON. And to display text on the screen we use the glut Bitmap functions.

**Software Requirement:**
1. CodeBlocks IDE 
2. OpenGL libraries 
3. Latest version of C
